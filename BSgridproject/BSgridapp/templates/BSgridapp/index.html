    <p>Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or
        build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components,
        and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

        Today we’re shipping Bootstrap v4.3.1 and v3.4.1 to patch an XSS
        vulnerability, CVE-2019-8331. Also included in v4.3.1 is a small fix to some RFS (responsive font sizes)
        mixins that were added in v4.3.0.

        Earlier this week a developer reported an XSS issue similar to the data-target vulnerability that was fixed in
        v4.1.2 and v3.4.0: the data-template attribute for our tooltip and popover plugins lacked proper XSS sanitization
        of the HTML that can be passed into the attribute’s value.
